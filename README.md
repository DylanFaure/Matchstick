Epitech Project.

- Use the command "make re" to create "matchstick"
- Use the commande "./matchstick nb1 nb2" ==> nb1 the number of lines (1 < nb1 < 100)
                                          ==> nb2 the maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn (nb2 > 0)
You play at first all the time.
First, the computer asks you which line you want to play ;
Then, the computer asks you how many matches you want to delete ;
After that, the AI plays instantly and it's your turn again.
